## Introduction:

The Tech Academy Live Project was both an exercise in the Agile/Scrum method of Project Management and a great experience in diving into the inner workings of the Python based web-framework Django. I spent two weeks working with a team of collegues. 










<!--For the last two weeks of my time at the tech academy, I worked with my peers in a team developing a full scale MVC/MVVM Web Application in C#. Working on a legacy codebase was a great learning oppertunity for fixing bugs, cleaning up code, and adding requested features. There were some big changes that could have been a large time sink, but we used what we had to deliver what was needed on time. I saw how a good developer works with what they have to make a quality product. I worked on several back end stories that I am very proud of. Because much of the site had already been built, there were also a good deal of front end stories and UX improvements that needed to be completed, all of varying degrees of difficulty. Everyone on the team had a chance to work on front end and back end stories. Over the two week sprint I also had the opportunity to work on some other project management and team programming skills that I'm confident I will use again and again on future projects

<!--Below are descriptions of the stories I worked on, along with code snippets and navigation links. I also have some full code files in this repo for the larger functionalities I implemented.
